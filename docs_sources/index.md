# test index page
### added new heading to test

### added another heading, deployed wihtout building

#### added another heading directly in the gh-branch, no mkdocs deploy, just pushed the changes
This did NOT work!!!
The step to build the docs from the md files is not run! This means that deploying to github pages requires the mkdocs tool to be run locally to deploy.
